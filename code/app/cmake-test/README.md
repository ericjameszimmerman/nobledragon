# CMake Test - FreeRTOS Idle Test

This is the freertos_idletest.c built with CMake for the Micromint Lincoln 60 SBC (http://wiki.micromint.com/index.php/Lincoln-60_Manual) This is an older board, but one that I had on-hand for initial testing / demoing.

The original project was with IAR embedded workbench.
